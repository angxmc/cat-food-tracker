# Cat Food Tracker

Cat Food Tracker is a web application designed for cat owners to calculate their pet's daily calorie needs and determine the appropriate amounts of wet and dry food based on product-specific calorie densities. Whether you're aiming for a balanced diet or adjusting for your cat's body condition, this tool helps you plan your catâ€™s meals with ease.

## Features

- **Calorie Calculation:**  
  Estimates your cat's daily calorie requirement using the Resting Energy Requirement (RER) formula and adjusts based on body condition (underweight, ideal, overweight).

- **Unit Conversion:**  
  Supports both kilograms (kg) and pounds (lbs).

- **Food Ratio Selection:**  
  Choose from various food ratios such as 100% wet, 100% dry, 50/50, 30/70, 20/80, or 10/90 for wet/dry food splits.

- **Portion Sizing:**  
  Calculate the grams needed of wet and dry food based on their calories per gram.

- **Extensibility:**  
  Easily extend the project to integrate with external APIs (e.g., Amazon Product Advertising API) or add a backend for more advanced features.
